# How to use bar chart
Here's an example code regarding the use of bar chart: 

```yaml
---
  dashboard "Example": 
    - 
      bar chart: 
        columns: 
          - 
            - "Apples"
            - 3
          - 
            - "Oranges"
            - 2
          - 
            - "Pears"
            - 2
